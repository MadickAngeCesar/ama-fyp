Always document any new types, interfaces, classes, functions, or complex logic added to the codebase. Use JSDoc style comments for functions and methods, including descriptions of parameters and return values.

Ensure that all public-facing components and APIs have clear and concise documentation to facilitate ease of use and maintenance.

When updating existing code, review and update the associated documentation to reflect any changes made.
